# Guidelines

Any contributions to Ticketbooth must abide by these criteria:

* Ticketbooth only supports blockchains based on the Stratis full node. If you wish to port Ticketbooth to another blockchain, feel free to fork it.
* Overall gas fees for all parties should be minimised where possible.
* Personal data cannot be publicly accessible on the blockchain and must only be accessible by the parties necessary for Ticketbooth to function.
* Features are not developed to work with a specific closed source platform. If you wish to develop a specific feature, again, feel free to fork it.

If you become aware of any possibility of violation to these criteria, please create an issue.
